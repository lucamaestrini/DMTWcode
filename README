  The R package named 'DMTWpackage' contains functions for performing Naïve and
Streamlined Variational Bayesian Inference on Linear Mixed Models with Nested
('two-level' or 'three-level') Random Effects and Fixed Effects admitting a
Gaussian prior specification (as in Nolan et al., 2020) or shrinkage-inducing
global-local prior specifications (as in Degani et al., 2021).
For the latter family of priors, the package contains functions for the
'Laplace', 'Horseshoe' and 'Normal-Exponential-Gamma' distributions.

  All the functions are implemented in the low-level C++ language, and are
contained in the 'src' folder. Their content is summarised in the following table.
The input description is described within each file.
